# __PixPective__

## Deployed on Heroku <a href="https://nameless-depths-39133.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow"> here.</a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Overview:
PixPective allows people to upload pictures into a "library" which will then save the files and "Display" them in a video or flipbook format with pictures from other users that were attending the same event.  This way, eveyone can get a more comprehensive view of the event that they attended.


## How It Works (Picspective Program flow):

- New event created and QR Code generated and printed for others to use

- Users upload photos to repository

- Photos are taken by the app and a video or flipbook is created

- Photos are stored in a library and given the name of the event (flipbook or canvas)

- Users can log in and see the photos online


## Pages in Application

- Landing Page - Users are allowed to Sign In or Sign Up.

- User Login Page - Allows user to log in to the application securely.

- Account Creation Page - Allows new users to create an accout.

- Home Page - Users are able to Scan a QRCode (via QRscan Button).  They can also use the NavBar to access Events, Create Event, About and Contact.

- Events Page - Users can Search events (via the Search Events Button), Scroll through the events, Go to an event library (via the See More Button).

- Create Events Page - Allows users to Create an Event (and QR Code for that Event).

- About Page - Shows Limits of Liability for PixPective.

- Contact Page - Show a brief about the Team that created tis program and has a Support Email address listed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
