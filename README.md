## Deployment on Heroku is no longer functioning due to  AWS database license expiration and dependency issues. Please reference code for information regarding the function of the site.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Overview:
PixPective allows people to upload pictures into a "library" which will then save the files and "Display" them in a video or flipbook format with pictures from other users that were attending the same event.  This way, eveyone can get a more comprehensive view of the event that they attended.


## How It Works (Picspective Program flow):

- New event created and QR Code generated and printed for others to use

- Users upload photos to repository

- Photos are taken by the app and a video or flipbook is created

- Photos are stored in a library and given the name of the event (flipbook or canvas)

- Users can log in and see the photos online
